# Gitopper

GitOps for the non-Kubernetes folks.

Watch a remote git repo, pull changes and HUP the service process. For a design doc see:
<https://miek.nl/2022/november/15/provisioning-services/>.

A sparse (but with full history) git checkout will be done, so each service will only see the files
it will actually need. Several bind mounts are then setup to give the service access to the file in
Git. If the target directories don't exist, they will be created, with the current user - if
specified.

This tool does little more than just pull the repo, but the little it brings to the table allows for
a GitOps workflow without resorting to Kubernetes like environments.

## Features Implemented

From the doc:

> * metrics, so rollouts/updates can be tracked;
> * diff detection, so we know state doesnâ€™t reconcile;
> * out of band rollbacks;
> * no client side processing;
> * canarying.

- *Metrics*: are included see below, they export a Git hash, so a rollout can be tracked.
- *Diff detection*: possible using the metrics or gitopperctl.
- *Out of band rollbacks*: use gitopperctl to bypass the normal Git workflow.
- *No client side processing*: files are used as the are in the Git repo.
- *Canarying*: give a service a different branch to check out.

## Quick Start

- Install grafana OSS version from the their website (just using this as a test case, nothing
  special here)
- Compile the gitopper binary: `go build`
- Start as root: `sudo ./gitopper -c config.toml -h grafana.atoom.net`

And things should work then. I.e. in /etc/grafana you should see the content of the
*miekg/blah-origin* repository.

The checked out git repo in /tmp/grafana1/grafana-server should _only_ contain the grafana directory
thanks to the sparse checkout. Changes made to the `crap` subdir in that repo do not trigger a
grafana restart (not even sure grafana actually needs a restart).

Then with cmd/gitopperctl/gitopperctl you can query the server:

~~~
% ./gitopperctl list services @localhost
#  SERVICE         HASH                                     STATE  INFO  CHANGED

~~~

## Services

A service can be in 4 states: OK, FREEZE, ROLLBACK (which is a FREEZE to a previous commit) and
BROKEN.

These state are not carried over when gitopper crashes/stops (maybe we want this to be persistent,
would be nice to have this state in the git repo somehow?).

* `OK`: everything is running and we're tracking upstream.
* `FREEZE`: everything is running, but we're not tracking upstream.
* `ROLLBACK`: everything is running, but we're not tracking upstream *and* we're pinned to an older
  commit. This state is quickly followed by FREEZE if we were successful rolling back, otherwise
  BROKEN.
* `BROKEN`: something with the service is broken, we're still tracking upstream.

ROLLBACK is a transient state and quickly moves to FREEZE, unless something goes wrong then it
becomes BROKEN.

## Config File

~~~ toml
[global]
upstream = "https://github.com/miekg/blah-origin"  # repository where to download from
mount = "/tmp"                                     # directory where to download to, mount+service is used as path

[[services]]
machine = "grafana.atoom.net" # hostname of the machine, so a host knows when to pick this up.
branch = "main"               # what branch to check out
service = "grafana-server"    # service identifier, if it's used by systemd it must be the systemd service name
package = "grafana"           # as used by package mgmt, may be empty (not implemented yet)
user = "grafana"              # do the check out with this user
action = "reload"             # call systemctl <action> <service> when the git repo changes.
mount = "/tmp/grafana1"       # where to put the downloaded download (we don't care - might be removed)
dirs = [
    { local = "/etc/grafana", link = "grafana/etc" },
    { local = "/var/lib/grafana/dashboards", link = "grafana/dashboards" }
]

## REST Interface

See proto/proto.go for the defined interface. Interaction is REST, thus JSON. You can

* list all defined machines
* list services run on this host
* list a specific service

* freeze a service to the current git commit
* unfreeze a service, i.e. to let it pull again
* rollback a service to a specific commit

## Metrics

The following metrics are exported:

* gitopper_service_info{"service", "hash", "state"}, where 'hash' is unbounded, but we really care
  about that value.
* gitopper_machine_git_errors_total - total number of errors when running git.
* gitopper_machine_git_ops_total - total number of git runs.

Metrics are available under the /metrics endpoint.

## Exit Code

Gitopper has following exit codes:

0 - normal exit
2 - SIGHUP seen (wait systemd to restart us)

## Bootstrapping

There are a couple of options that allow gitopper to bootstrap itself *and* make gitopper to be
managed by gitopper. Basically those options allow you to specificy a service on the command line.
Gitopper will check out the repo and then proceed to read the config *in that repo* and setup
everything from there.

I.e.:

~~~
... -c config.toml -U https://github.com/miekg/blah-origin -D gitopper -M /tmp/
~~~

Will sparse check out (only the `gitopper` directory) of the repo *blah-origin* in /tmp/gitopper and will
then proceed to parse the config file /tmp/gitopper/gitopper/config.toml and proceed with a normal
startup. This adds 'gitopper' twice because we set the service to it as well, and that also becomes
part of the path, so /tmp/"gitopper"/"gitopper"/config.toml.

The gitopper service self is *also* added to the managed services which you can inspect with
gitopperctl.

## Client

A client is included in cmd/gitopperctl. It has its own README.md.

## Authentication

TODO...? Some plugins based solution?

## TODO

* Authentication for destructive action
* TLS (certmagic?)
