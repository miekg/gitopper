.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This little command outputs a few lines that can be inserted into any file managed by gitopper. It
shows the upstream repo where edits can be done. If that URL contains "github.com" it uses GitHub's
way of pointing to files in a repo, otherwise GitLab is assumed. This command must be called while
sitting inside a git repository.

Currently it outputs (in English, Dutch is also an option):
