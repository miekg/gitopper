=====

## Name

gitopperhdr - output lines telling where to edit the file managed by gitopper

## Synopsis

`gitopperhdr` **FILE**

## Description

This little command outputs a few lines that can be inserted into any file managed by gitopper. It
shows the upstream repo where edits can be done. If that url contains github.com it uses GitHub's
way of pointing to files in a repo, otherwise GitLab is assumed. This command must be called while
sitting inside a git repository.

Currently it outputs (in English, Dutch is also an option):

~~~
# Do not edit this file, it's managed by `gitopper'. The canonical source can be found at:
#   https://github.com/miekg/gitopper/blob/cmd/gitopperhdr/main.go
~~~

Options are:

**-p**
: set comment character, default to `#`

**-l**
: set language, `en` is the default, the other supported value is `nl` for Dutch.
