# gitopperhdr

This little command outputs a few lines that can be inserted into any file managed by gitopper. It
shows the upstream repo where edits can be done. If that url contains github.com it uses GitHub's
way of pointing to files in a repo, otherwise GitLab is assumed.

Currently it outputs (in English, Dutch is also an option):

~~~
# Do not edit this file, it's managed by `gitopper'. The canonical source can be found at:
#   https://github.com/miekg/gitopper/blob/cmd/gitopperhdr/main.go
~~~

Use `-p` to use a different comment string, it defaults to '#'. `-l` can be used to set the
language.
